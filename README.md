# Symbolic-Interpretability
This README serves as the foundational blueprint for the repository, outlining its purpose, architecture, and recursive protocols. It is both a map and a mirror, designed to resonate with researchers, developers, and philosophers seeking to explore the strange loops of cognition, as inspired by Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach.
